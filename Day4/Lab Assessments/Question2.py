'''
Create a class BankAccount that:		
		
1. Uses a parameterized constructor to initialize account_number and balance		
		
2. Implements methods deposit(amount) and withdraw(amount)		
		
3. Uses a destructor to display a message when the object is deleted		
		
4. Handle invalid withdrawal using proper checks
